This is the lab in a computer simulation and computing experiment

                          Task
I. Сonstruct polynomials that will acquire corresponding values 
    at the interpolation nodes, based on the point system defined 
    by the arrays of arguments and function values.

   For the system of this point on the plane:
    1.Сonstruct splines of the 3rd degree of defect 1.
    2.Make a plot of functions.
    
II. Using the least-squares method, plot the curves given by the 
    system of points defined by the arrays of arguments 
    and function values.
    It is assumed that there is a known functional law for multiple points.
   
   Find the system of points on the plane that are optimal by the standard deviation.
   
   Array of argument values:
   -1.6000 -1.2000 -0.8000 -0.4000 0 0.4000 0.8000 1.2000 1.6000 2.0000
   
   Array of function values:
   4.3200 3.2800 2.8800 3.1200 4.0000 5.5200 7.6800 10.4800 13.9200 18.0000
